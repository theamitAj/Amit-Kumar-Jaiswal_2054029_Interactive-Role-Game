# Raja, Mantri, Chor, Sipahi
This project is a simple implementation of the traditional Indian game “Raja, Mantri, Chor, Sipahi.” 
# The game involves assigning roles to four players and maintaining scores throughout the turns. Currently, it’s a command-line program, but I plan to develop it into a web app in the future.

# Features
Input player names and randomly assign roles (RAJA, MANTRI, CHOR, SIPAHI).
Guess the Chor (thief) as a Sipahi (guard).
Keep track of scores across turns.
Restart the game with scores initialized to zero.
# Usage
Run the program.
Enter the names of the four players.
Roles (RAJA, MANTRI, CHOR, SIPAHI) will be assigned randomly.
Sipahi players can guess the Chor.
Scores are updated after each turn.
Restart the game to reset scores.
